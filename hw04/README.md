# Stat 133, Fall 2017

HW04 Assignment
- Student name: Lindsay Dahlen
- Github username: ldahlen
- Lab section: 107
- GSI: Minchul Shin

-----
This homework was about visualizing the grades of the Stat 133 class using a Shiny app.

I used the tutorials and old labs as resources for this homework. I also used

Comments and Reflections
- This was my first time writing unit tests.
- On a scale of 0 to 10, I found the logic of testthat tests to be a 10, or very confusing.
- This was my first time working with ggvis.
- On a scale of 0 to 10, I found the syntax of ggvis to be 10, or very confusing
- This was my first time working with conditional panels in shiny.
- On a scale of 0 to 10, I found working with conditional panels to be 100, in  that I didn't understand ow to make them at all.
- I like ggplot the best because I can understand it the best, and I think it is looks and functions better
than the base plots
- No one helped me in doing this assignment
-The most time consuming part was working on the tests and functions. I didn't even get to the shiny app.
