### Recipe

Kransekake: *Norwegian Wedding cake*
------------------------------------

This cake is a traditional Scandinavian cake sometimes made for weddings.
=========================================================================

Ingredients
===========

-   ½ kg. (1.25 lbs.) ground almonds
-   ½ kg. (1.25 lbs.) powdered sugar
-   1 dl. egg whites (about 3 eggs)
-   1 T. flour
-   Few drops of white vinegar
-   1.5 cups powdered sugar \#Tools
-   Kransekake forms
-   Bread kneading attachment for mixer
-   Oven \#Directions

1.  Mix all ingredients using bread kneading attachment on mixer. Roll dough into ½ " balls and press your finger into it to flatten a bit. Or roll dough out into 4-5" sticks.
2.  If using kransekake forms, roll out some dough until about 1 cm. thick, spraying forms with oil-and-flour spray. Fill circles with rolled dough, filling the largest one last in case you don't have enough dough
3.  Bake 8-10 min. at 410 degrees. Cookies will be pale (little or no browning), but make sure there are no dark, raw spots. Let cookies cool before removing from pan.
4.  Make white icing by mixing 1.5 cups powdered sugar with a few drops of white vinegar, then enough drops of water to make the icing smooth. Put icing into a sandwich-size plastic bag, twist it closed, removing all the air. Snip a tiny piece off the corner of the bag.
5.  Put the four largest rings aside. Use a little icing to fasten the next largest ring to the serving plate. Apply icing in scallops on top of the ring and put the next largest ring on top. The scalloped frosting will hold each ring in place. Put scalloped icing on the extra 4 rings, and when the icing is dry, break them up and spread them around the finished cake
6.  To decorate, use small Norwegian flags, marzipan fruit, tiny wrapped presents, or foiled wrapped candy all on stickpins or toothpicks.

==============================================================================================================================================

The general form of the equation is as follows:
===============================================

/ \[ax^2+bx+c=0 /\]

The Quadratic Formula is as follows:
====================================

### Reflection

**What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?**
=============================================================

> I'm still a little confused on how to use RStudio.

**What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?**

> Using Markdown was easy-ish. The tutorial was really useful.

**Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it? If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?**
=========================================================================================================================================================================================

> This was my first time using Markdown. I thought it would be really difficult to pick up, but it wasn't too bad.

**Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?**
===========================================================================================

> I didn't use any help to complete this assignment, aside from lookings some things up on the internet.

**How much time did it take to complete this HW?**
==================================================

> I took mabye about 1.5 hour total over the course of 3 days to complete the warm-up.

**What was the most time consuming part?**
